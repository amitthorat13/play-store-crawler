<title>Get real Gameloft</title>
<review> Your freemium apps are getting unbelievable you can get 3 top games for &Acirc;&pound;3 and this game costs about &Acirc;&pound;35 to give you a very slight edge lol who's buying these coins. Plus with most freemium games you update with ever increasing difficult levels who are you trying to bleed here? Our children? Well it is a kids game? Talk about taking candy from a baby! </review>

<title>So much fun! But.....</title>
<review> The game is challenging and super fun, but it's very hard to collect or earn tokens. Bananas only go so far as most costumes /power-ups cost hundreds or thousands of tokens. I'm not willing to pay real dollars for tokens on a game. You should be able to earn more tokens, or at least be able to buy them with bananas! Very frustrating! </review>

The latest update will download content here, then you launch and it downloads again (5 min), then you're forced to watch the intro again, then it downloads again then it loads then you can play. Updating is an adventure by itself. 10 min later I'm playing. Oohhff! </review>

All in all it's a good game my daughter got 125,476 for best score and she's 4 1/2 shell be 5 soon. I couldn't even get close I only got to 106,343 so she's really good and it keeps her occupied for hrs. Love It! !!!!!! </review>

<review> My app keeps crashing when I go into it, it gets as far as the downloading screen after the 2 ads at the start when you open it. I'm so depressed I can't play it now! 5 stars for being so addictive tho. </review>

<title>not smooth even on s3</title>
<review> for an android game this is great. but I played it on iPad mini first and it ran perfectly on that. on my s3 it takes forever to load each time (58s), ages to start a game after hitting play (29s), and is not very smooth graphics once playing. an s3 should easily be able to handle it so I guess it is an issue with the game. back to iPad version. </review>

<review> This game is really cool has cool graphics and very challenging but ever since I updated it. The reaction time it's super slow. It freezes up while I'm playing and doesn't catch my movements. Now playing this game is super irritating. Going to uninstall if this glitch is not fixed. I recommend no one update. Keep the original version. The new one sucks money balls </review>

<review> This game used to be so much fun, but this newest update sucks. Ever since the update, the game lags and doesn't respond to my touch, and I'm always running into things when I tried jumping over or rolling under. I have a high score of 186,000+ from before the update, now I'm lucky to get to 5000. Game is so unresponsive, it's no fun to play anymore. Uninstall. </review>

<title>Unplayable since the last update</title>
<review> I had previously rated this 5 stars but since the last update it is virtually unplayable. The responsiveness to the swipe controls is gone so you end up either running straight into things as it failed to recognise the action or you over compensate as you see no movement to the request and do it again only to find it eventually moves twice. Why has adding a new level slowed this down so much? </review>

<review> Since latest update can no longer skip intro film, other than that... Great game, but premium cash items are farrrrrr to expensive (&Acirc;&pound;35 for some characters) even to consider. Not enough in advertising based premium currency offers either. So rather a limited game in those respects. However it is enjoyable and kills time :) </review>

<title>Lags after Beach update</title>
<review> Was happily play this awesome game before devs release an update. After the beach update, it lags a lot. Getting bumped into obstacles, late jump/roll...can't enjoy the game at all. Not to mention the huge app size and in-app additional downloads. </review>

<title>No child control, huge size, battery eater</title>
<review> The game is playable, but its dangers are many. There is no way to prevent your kids from tapping the huge, inviting Facebook and G+ sharing buttons on the home screen. Unless you are into sharing every breath you take on social networks, avoid this game. It's also worth noting that the game is huge (400MB), that it downloads large amounts of data almost each time you start it, and that it drains the battery like nothing you've seen before. </review>

<review> With the new update the game can only be played while the phone is online. I currently don't have service on my phone so now I can only play when I can pick up a wifi signal...used to be able to play offline. Please fix this. Otherwise my rating would be 5 stars. </review>

<title>Lag</title>
<review> I am deleting this app. It was fun till the upgrade. The lag in the game sucks really bad. I had to start over 100%. Zero everything . Fix the lag and I may play again.Sense I up graded to the beach version there has been a major lag in the game. I touch the screen and it doesn't react till a second or so later. </review>

<title>Terrible updates</title>
<review> The game came out it was great. The more updates the more issues. Constant issues with crashing on the galaxy s3. Will be on installing until the developers find a way to fix issues. In the last update as of today, would not save previous game history. Due to the update started the entire game from new. </review>

<review> I ended up updating this game for the newest version, with the beach now and ever since did. EVERYTHING has been messing up on me, between making me start ALL OVER, back at 0, making me restart with Facebook and my game has been going slower than EVER, keeps freezing on me so that I die everytime, no matter what. It really aggravates me because I absolute LOVE this game and I was so far in it too, I was about to beat my cousin &amp; it made me start at 0!! Smfh ;( love the game but very disappointed. Please fix </review>

I recently filled out a tapjoy ad for tokens, i never received these tokens i emailed tapjoy about this and they continued to ignore me. I wrote the game developers an email and within 12 hours i got an excuse from tapjoy and my tokens from the developers. Keep up the great work on the game and drop tapjoy. </review>

<review> Fun so far. Wish they wouldn't ask for real money, I'll play until I can't and then ill probably delete it. No way I'm spending $4 on minion bananas. I'd rather buy the game for $1.99 </review>

<review> A simply addictive game. Fun and easy... once you get used to it of course. It gets more difficult the further you can run. Quite amusing and that's saying something because I am easily bored and tire of certain games quickly. Awesome for any age, honestly I'm 22 and many friends around my age also play. </review>

I won't use them at all and seem to come back to them being gone. It's happened at least 3 times...today being another time. While customer support does help me, I am irritated that it keeps happening. </review>

How ever,after this latest update,it brings much more lag to my phone and make it unplayable rather than the previous update. Sorry for the 2 star rating,but if you guys,the developers fix this lag problem soon,i'll give you 4-5 stars. </review>

<review> Excellent game five stars without a doubt ... I just would rather the price of some of the minions to be a little more affordable ... aside from that I can play all day and not get bored bcuz your not running on one straight path and you're constantly able to switch to different areas to run </review>

<review> Noemally I wouldn't even review an app, however this one needs recognition. I thought this game would be somewhat childish, but I found myself playing it constantly. It was addicting and enjoyable, and the best part is that it is free. Although you can buy tokens in the game with real money, they're not required to play. Great game, overall. </review>

<review> Super fun to play. The new beach level is cool. A little choppy now, not sure of that has to do with the update, just feels a little different. Other than that, we love it! </review>

<title>Saving Data</title>
<review> Firstly, thank you Gameloft for making this game free!! But, I have an issue with login. Why keep the save data seperately? If i play with connection, the game will saved with my facebook account (i linked this game with fb). And then if i play offline still ok. Then the real problem, I play with connection again, but the game notice two save data, which the offline data have slighthy diffrent hi-score than the &quot;online&quot; data. Please, fix this &quot;Little&quot; problem, otherwise nothing else complain. :) Thanks!! </review>

<review> The new beach location is fun and I like the new notifications for &quot;near misses.&quot; But I noticed that game play is much more laggy and the controls are not as responsive since the update, which makes it a little frustrating to play. Also, wish there was more to spend bananas on after power-ups have all been purchased. I have so many bananas but nothing to spend them on. </review>

Second... yeah... let's try that again. Boom! Bought some tokens. Transaction failed... I got deducted. My unease grows worse and worse everyday. -_- Not sure if Google play wallet system is stupid... or Gameloft's. Edited... Emailed all the details and still no response. It's official. Gameloft's ISO 9000 sucks. Edited: 1 to 3 stars I see some progress... but I'll try again next week to see if they fixed the bugs. Though I gotta admit. The Minion beach was a decent update. </review>

<review> It becomes laggish since the last 2 updates, extremely laggy since the last one and got some FC sometimes . It was cool before the updates. I don't know the reason, my phone is strong enough and as I said there was no problem before. Maybe it's a kind of optimization or something.

<review> This game is loads of fun, but you collect many bananas which, eventually, you have no use for, then you have to use coins to get anything else. The coins are hard to come by OR you can purchase for ridiculous prices. If they allowed you to buy coins with the bananas I would give 5 stars. </review>

<review> I used to like this game. When I had a spare minute, I opened it up and had a bit of fun jumping and dodging obstacles. Until the last release. Since maybe a week ago, every time I open it, it starts to download something, which always takes forever. Worse still, it's implemented very poorly and is trying to do it in-game, meaning your download starts again if you restart the game. Utterly unusable. </review>

<review> I never get sick of this game. It gets a little harder after u run so far but the great thing is u dont get stuck on a level and need lives or anything. You can play as much as u want. No fb nonsense. I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little laggy at times and makes it hard to play. This has only occurred since it was recently updated. So it will hopefully be fixed. </review>

<review> This games deserve a 5* but I will give it a 2* because of the Problem I love this game but after the update nothing seems to work. Swiping up, down, right and left does not work. You do not have any control of the game anymore. Why does it needs to download every time you open the game? It also froze up a lot. This is one of the best game I have played so far but I can no longer play it because of this problem that I am having with it after the the new download. Please fix this problem so I can get back to my Minions. Thank you. </review>

<review> Pros: Way to go developers! Fun game! Cons: 1. Wayyyy too expensive on most of everything! Even with sales banannas, costumes and coins are way too expensive!!! $49.99 FOR JUST ONE MINION COSTUME???? YOU MUST THINK WE ARE ALL FOOLS. You NEED to bring the cost down...WAY DOWN; PERIOD! Greed like that will keep most people away. 2. More levels! 3. More in-game costume bananas purchase. 4.BRING BACK 2X GLOWING BANANNAS! (Helps us see better on levels sometimes) Fix these, then 5 stars &amp; G+ thumbs up. </review>

<review> Typical running game. Love minions, but this is pathetic. First, it is huge...20 MB installer, 50MB data, then constant huge download for...unknown. Also it runs slow. I mean REALLY slow. lastly, unresponsive controls is the final straw. 20 minutes to download and uninstalled after 15 minutes. </review>

<title>Update is full of BUG!</title>
<review> Gaming on Dhd. RANK ON UPDATE ONLY! Pls correct,i cant play w! Game/movement lagged,fractured, frozen/closes, gestures influence nothing/later at minion movement(!!), masking err's, loooong loading time, download at all, fail load on game, &quot;auto revive&quot; on end, gyro guide works not on beach slide. I wish I didnt update despite new place, new more exciting obj's, new musics (but welcome to hear eg.mexican theme within the Lair run...) DEVS! PLS LET US ENJOY AGAIN!! Now unusuable! </review>

<review> Very fun and you don't have to buy anything to get ahead in the game. The kids and I enjoy this game together and they love all the minions antics. I highly recommend downloading this game but you need a fast processor on your phone or tablet. </review>

<title>Doesn't work</title>
<review> I tried installing this game a month ago and I had a problem of game not loading. Tried installing it again and yet the same problem occurs. My screen turns black (more grey actually) and starts constantly rotating with loading sign occasionally appearing. I contacted support, they were nice and all but nothing they said to me helped and then I was told I will be noticed when the problem is solved and I haven't hear a thing since. </review>

<title>Update not good</title>
<review> Since the last update the game is not playable anymore. Responsiveness is bad and it lags more than ever. Also had to uninstall several games, because it takes very much space for some reason. My son is very disappointed, because he can't play it anymore. Please fix the lag and responsiveness and make it playable again. Before this update it was a great game. </review>
